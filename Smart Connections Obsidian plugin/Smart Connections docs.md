A plugin for the Obsidian note-taking application that leverages the Smart Environment to enhance note management and discovery.

- **Read-Only Interaction**: Provides a window into the Smart Environment without editing capabilities.
- **Shared Settings**: Uses the same configuration file as the Smart Connect App for seamless integration.
