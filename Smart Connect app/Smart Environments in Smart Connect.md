Smart Environments are a core component of the Smart Connect app, designed to provide seamless integration between your local notes and AI-powered processing. By defining which files are accessible and how they are processed, Smart Environments empower users to interact with their data in a more intelligent and personalized manner. Whether youâ€™re managing your knowledge base, syncing content from Obsidian, or excluding specific sections from processing, Smart Environments offer flexible configuration options tailored to your needs.

##### New Environment
- **Creating a New Environment**:
	- Open the **Smart Connect** app.
	- If no environments are found, click the **New Environment** button.
	- Click on the **Folder** field to select your Obsidian vault folder.
	- The new environment will appear in the Smart Environments list.

- **Renaming the Environment**:
	- It's recommended to rename the environment to match your vault name for compatibility with Obsidian-specific features.
