After signing up using the special link in your supporter welcome email:

1. **Download and Installation**: The Smart Connections chat can be used in the web browser and through Progressive Web Apps (PWA) technology on mobile devices. This means there's no need to download the app from app stores.
2. **Accessing Campfire**: Simply navigate to the [chat](https://chat.smartconnections.app) on your mobile browser. The website should prompt you to "Add to Home Screen." This adds an icon to your device, allowing for quicker access, much like a native app.
3. **Enable Notifications**: Once Campfire is added to your home screen, you can manage notifications for each "chat room" by clicking the icon at the top of the page to change the level of notifications between "all new messages," "mentions only," and "none."
