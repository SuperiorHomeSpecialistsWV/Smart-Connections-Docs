# Refine Your View: Pinpoint Precision: Filtering Inbound & Outbound Links
![[assets/screenshots/connections_pane_filters.gif]]
## Purpose / Objective
Feeling overwhelmed by too many cross-links? Hone in on the exact notes you need. Used to better manage massive vaultsâ€”gain laser-focused clarity in seconds.

### User Goal
Learn how toggling outlink/inlink filters affects which notes appear, giving you total control over your vault's relationships.

### Logline
Advanced usage for power-users: Filter out entire categories of links and see only your most relevant connections.

### Real-World Use Case
Researchers organizing large vaults might hide outbound links (outlinks) or inbound links (inlinks) to see only notes which may be otherwise overlooked.

## Workflows
### Demo 1: Create 'SimilarIdea.md' Referencing 'SecondNote'

#### Step 1: Create/Open 'SimilarIdea.md'
Open or create a new note named "SimilarIdea.md."
#### Step 2: Reference 'SecondNote'
Add text referencing "SecondNote," e.g., "This is a note about my identity referencing SecondNote."
