objective: markdown documentation for each test

There should be two markdown files for each test file, the first (with extension `.lol.md`) clarifies the marketing strategy, analyzing each content section and strategy employed to maximize Lollapalooza. The second (file extension `.demo.md`) is the public-facing content based on the strategy.

File name: same as test file with `.demo.md` extension

# {Key Feature} {Test / Demo Set Title}
> **Heading Optimization Tip**: Use bold, descriptive headings that clarify the reader’s next step or benefit. For example, instead of a heading like "Overview," opt for something like "**Unlock Instant Insights: Overview of Key Feature**" to spark interest and guide scanning readers.
## Purpose / Objective

- **Immediate Hook**
  - A one-liner that addresses a core pain point or aspiration ("Overwhelmed by endless note references? Here’s the simplest way to bring clarity.").
  - Connects to an urgent, universal problem for your target audience.
- **Authority Cue**
    - Mention credibility or expertise briefly ("Used by top researchers at University X").

### User Goal
- A short statement describing the end-user’s desired outcome in a way that sparks empathy and ambition ("Gain a comprehensive overview of all related notes in seconds").
- Subtly imply exclusivity or 'insider knowledge' ("Discover the same technique that leading content pros swear by").
### Logline
- A marketing-friendly, 'must-read' tagline:
  - Combine data, social proof, and a promise of future gain ("Cut your linking workflow time by 50%, just like 10,000+ advanced researchers already have!").
### Real-World Use Case

- **Emotional Resonance**
    - Brief narrative that highlights a believable scenario: "Imagine you’re on a deadline—10 tabs open, 50 notes scattered. In just a few clicks, you unify everything into a single, organized hub."
- **Concrete Context**
    - Show how this scenario plays out for real roles (researchers, devs, entrepreneurs).

## Workflows

Break down the entire test into smaller "Demos," each layering a different persuasion trigger.
> **Heading Optimization Tip**: Label each demo with a benefit-driven or transformation-driven heading, e.g., "**Demo 1: From Clutter to Clarity**" instead of just "Demo 1."
### Demo X: {Short Title / 'Transformation Point'}

1. **Steps (Clarity + Scarcity)**
   - Step-by-step instructions that are easy to follow yet hint at specialized knowledge ("Click 'Open Connections Pane'—a feature only available to premium-level users.").
   - **Screenshot Placeholder**:
     ```
     ![Step X Screenshot](path/to/screenshotX.png "Briefly describe what's shown in the screenshot.")
     ```
   - Keep instructions concise while highlighting any unique or advanced aspects.
2. **Environment / Setup (Authority + Consistency)**
   - Mention recognized frameworks or platforms ("Tested on MacOS with Zettelkasten-inspired vault structure, validated by power users.").
   - If relevant, include placeholders for environment-specific screenshots:
     ```
     ![Environment Setup](path/to/setup_screenshot.png "Show environment config or system settings.")
     ```
3. **Reproducible Actions (Commitment + Consistency)**
   - Encourage users to replicate the steps themselves to build trust and positive momentum.
   - If a complex sequence is involved, show multiple screenshots that illustrate each critical point in the workflow:
     ```
     ![Action Sequence Screenshot](path/to/action_seq.png "Depict multiple steps or a timeline of clicks.")
     ```
#### Display Text

- **Social Proof**
	- UI or system feedback that underscores instant benefits (“'15 relevant notes found—Optimized for maximum clarity.'”).
- **Screenshot Placeholder**:
  ```
  ![Display Text Screenshot](path/to/display_text.png "Show the UI message or pop-up.")
  ```
#### Expected Notifications

- **Positive Reinforcement**
	- "Success: 3 new relevant references automatically added to your key topics. This might’ve taken 30 minutes by hand."
- **Screenshot Placeholder**:
  ```
  ![Expected Notification Screenshot](path/to/notification.png "Show the success or confirmation message.")
  ```
#### Commands Used

- **Authority & Exclusivity**
	- Show advanced commands or shortcuts that demonstrate expert-level control ("Shift+Alt+Link to auto-link references. Hidden gem feature.").
#### Buttons Clicked

- **Simplicity & Visibility**
    - Remind users these actions are intuitive and user-friendly, prompting a sense of immediate capability (“Click ‘One-Click Filter’ to instantly refine thousands of notes.”).

(Repeat the above structure for each demo, layering additional persuasion factors.)

## Expected Results

- **Measurable ROI**
	- "Within 5 minutes, users save up to 2 hours of manual searching per day, which is _over 500 hours per year_ for a single researcher."
- **Story-Based Validation**
	- Summarize how this 'transformed' the sample user's workflow: "Kate, a PhD candidate, used this flow to reduce her research clutter and finished her literature review weeks ahead of schedule."
- **Social Proof & Future-Paced Vision**
	- "Join thousands of other users already leveraging these automations to stay ahead in their careers."
- **Soft Call to Action**
	- "Explore advanced usage in {Doc / Dev / Demo} for deeper customization and next-level efficiency."
## Additional Persuasion Layers to Consider

1. **Reciprocity**
		- Offer a bonus resource (“Claim a free 'Tips & Tricks' PDF by completing this demo yourself!”).
2. **Contrast**
    - Position the old method vs. the new method (“Manual linking: 2 hours of rummaging through notes vs. Automated linking: 10 seconds to scan an entire knowledge base.”).
3. **Scarcity / Urgency**
    - Indicate limited features or exclusive early access (“Advanced linking is only available in the upcoming beta—request access now before seats fill up.”).
4. **Unity**
    - Remind users you’re in this journey together (“We built this feature from your feedback—share how you’re using it so we can innovate further.”).

### Lollapalooza in Action

- **Emotional + Rational**: Combine narrative hooks (story-driven user success) with concrete data (time saved, ROI) to cover both emotive and logical bases.
- **Multiple Mental Models**: Social proof, authority, contrast, commitment, reciprocity, scarcity, and more—each small nudge stacks to create a 'Lollapalooza Effect'.
- **Genuine Value**: Despite the persuasive framing, the steps remain objectively useful for real product understanding and results.

> **Heading Optimization Tip**: For top-level sections, choose phrasing that combines an imperative verb with a promised outcome, e.g., "**Realize Instant Gains: Expected Results**" or "**Elevate Your Workflow: Additional Persuasion Layers**."
