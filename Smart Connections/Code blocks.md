## Purpose
Show how to use a fenced code block (````smart-connections````) inside Obsidian to render the Smart Connections pane dynamically.
### User Goal
Embed a "live" Smart Connections pane inside a note by using a `smart-connections` code block, then provide a query that updates in real time.
### Logline
Create living search blocks right in your documentsâ€”see relevant references instantly, no extra tabs needed!
## Workflow

### Step 1: Open a Note in Edit Mode
Open a note in Obsidian and switch to edit mode.
```

```

### Step 2: Insert a Code Fence
Insert a code fence using ```` ```smart-connections ````. For example:
``````md
```smart-connections
```
``````
```

```

### Step 3: Parse the Code Block
Move the cursor up (ArrowUp) so that Obsidian parses the code block. Observe the resulting connections pane.
```

```

### Step 4: Type a Query
Type a query into the code block (e.g., `query: "Similar references test"`).
```

```

### Step 5: Trigger Re-render
Arrow up again (or toggle out of the block) to trigger re-render. Confirm the block re-renders as a specialized "Lookup" pane.
```

```

### Step 6: Observe Semantic Search Results
Observe the code block now shows semantic search results based on the `query:` content.
