## Purpose / Objective
Think you've seen all Smart Connections can do? These hidden gems will surprise you.
### User Goal
Discover lesser-known features (e.g., 'Smart Random Note') that supercharge the note-linking experience.
### Logline
Explore advanced toggles and commandsâ€”jump to random relevant notes, switch embeddings, and more."
### Real-World Use Case
A user who's already comfortable with the basic workflow now wants a creative spark.

## Workflows

### Demo 1: Smart Random Note

#### Step 1: Open a Known Note
Open a known note (for example, `ExampleNote.md`), ensuring you have some connections available.
