# Vault-Wide Clarity: Try Lookup Mode for Semantic Search
![[assets/screenshots/lookup_pane.gif]]
## Purpose / Objective
Need a quick vault-wide search that goes deeper than keyword matching? The Lookup pane has you covered. Used to quickly surface semantically similar content based on your lookup query.
### User Goal
Learn how to switch from the standard Connections pane into a special 'Lookup' mode and type freeform queries for semantic results.
### Logline
Instantly scan your vault with flexible queriesâ€”no more guesswork or separate search plugins needed!
### Real-World Use Case
A researcher or busy professional wants to find every note referencing a single theme (like 'identity references') without manually scanning.
## Workflows
### Demo 1: Using the Lookup Pane
#### Step 1: Open the Lookup Button
In the Connections pane, click the "Lookup" button to switch to a lookup interface.

#### Step 3: Observe Search Results
Confirm the pane displays relevant notes matching your semantic query.

> **Note**: You can also use code blocks (`smart-connections`) inside a note to achieve a similar lookup workflow right within your documents.
