# Index / Overview of {Feature / Software / Plugin} Demos
## Purpose / Objective
- Briefly state the overarching goal of these tests/demos.
- Emphasize the dual role: **verify functionality** and **market the plugin's capabilities** through well-choreographed, real-world scenarios.
## Table of Contents
- **Test / Demo List**: Provide links or references to each test document or major workflow.
- Note which demos highlight specific "scenes" or "features" (e.g., "Semantic Search Demo", "Smart Connections Pane Demo").
## Global Setup & Prerequisites
- Summarize any required environment, plugin installation, or shared vault configuration.
  - Mention the *test vault* approach, if used, to showcase realistic sample notes.
  - Highlight any baseline steps (e.g., "Plugin enabled", "Software version X or above").
- Note any universal commands or default settings applied across all tests.
## Common FAQs / Troubleshooting
- Combine issues and solutions relevant to the entire suite of tests.
  - For instance, known plugin/OS incompatibilities, typical installation difficulties, or performance considerations.
- Keep test-specific troubleshooting in each individual test doc.
