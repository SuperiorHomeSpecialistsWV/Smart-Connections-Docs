# Getting Started with the Smart Note Visualizer
![[assets/screenshots/smart-note-visualizer-getting_started.gif]]
## Purpose / Objective
Want to see your notes from a bird's-eye view? The Smart Note Visualizer provides an intuitive graph-based representation, letting you quickly discover connections across your vault.

### User Goal
Install and enable the plugin in minutes, then verify that your vault's notes appear in a visual, interactive graph.

### Logline
Get from zero to a fully interactive graph in no time. Seamlessly explore and open notes by clicking on their nodes, all without leaving Obsidian.

### Real-World Use Case
Suppose you're juggling multiple projects or research topics. Instead of searching file by file, the Smart Note Visualizer surfaces your entire vault in one interactive view, making it easier to spot overlaps and big-picture structures.

## Workflows

### Demo 1: Installing and Verifying the Visualizer

#### Step 1: Open a Fresh Vault
Open or create an Obsidian vault where you'd like to install the Smart Note Visualizer plugin.

### Demo 2: Interacting with the Graph

#### Step 1: Hover or Click a Node
Move your cursor over a node to see the note title. Clicking a node focuses that note or opens it in the main editor (depending on your settings).

#### Step 2: Zoom and Pan
Use your mouse scroll or trackpad pinch gestures to zoom, and click-drag the background to pan around large vaults.

#### Step 3: Open a Note from the Graph
When you click on a node, the note opens in Obsidian. Confirm that the correct note is visible.

## Expected Results
- The 'Smart Connections Visualizer' appears under Community Plugins and installs successfully.
- A new ribbon icon or command palette entry is available to open the visualizer pane.
- Nodes are displayed in an interactive graph, which you can zoom, pan, hover, and click.
- Clicking a node opens the corresponding note in the main editor.
