In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving development world, integrating AI tools like ChatGPT into your workflow is becoming more common. But while these tools offer powerful capabilities, developers often face a major concern: **How do you share your code context without sacrificing privacy and security?**

Enter **Smart Context**, a **100% open-source** VS Code extension designed to make it easier and safer to manage code snippets and project context for use in AI toolsâ€”all while keeping your sensitive code **local and secure**.

### The Challenge Developers Face

When working with AI tools, developers often need to share snippets or entire project files as context for better responses. However, thereâ€™s a problem: using cloud-based services to copy and share code can expose sensitive information to external servers, especially in large or proprietary projects. Moreover, manual processes of gathering relevant text files across a project are time-consuming and prone to error.

### What is Smart Context?

**Smart Context** solves these issues by providing a **secure, local-first solution** for copying and managing code snippets. This VS Code extension respects your `.gitignore` file, ensuring only the necessary files are copiedâ€”without ever sending your code to the cloud.

Whether youâ€™re working on proprietary software, personal projects, or contributing to open-source, Smart Context allows you to safely and easily gather relevant text files into a single, easily sharable format, all while staying completely within your local development environment.

### Key Features of Smart Context

#### **1. 100% Open-Source**

Smart Context is fully open-source under the MIT License, meaning you can **inspect, modify, and contribute** to the codebase. No hidden features, no limitationsâ€”just a tool built for the community.

#### **2. Privacy and Security**

Unlike cloud-based alternatives, **Smart Context never uploads your code anywhere**. It works entirely on your machine, so your private or proprietary code stays safe. No external APIs are involved.

#### **3. Respects `.gitignore`**

Smart Context automatically reads and respects your `.gitignore` file, so it will only copy the files you want. This ensures that unnecessary or sensitive filesâ€”such as configuration or environment variablesâ€”are never included.

#### **4. Supports Multiple File Types**

The extension recognizes a wide range of text-based file formatsâ€”everything from `.js`, `.json`, and `.md` to `.py`, `.java`, `.xml`, and more. Whether youâ€™re working in front-end, back-end, or even data science, Smart Context has you covered.

#### **5. Simple and Efficient Workflow**

With Smart Context, thereâ€™s **no complex setup**. You can quickly copy folder contents with a simple right-click or a command from the Command Palette, making it a **seamless addition** to your existing workflow.

### How It Works

**Using Smart Context is simple:**

1. **Right-Click Method:**
    - In VS Codeâ€™s file explorer, right-click on a folder and select **"Smart Context: Copy Folder Contents to Clipboard"**.
    - Paste the copied contents wherever neededâ€”whether itâ€™s in a ChatGPT window, another code editor, or any document.
    
2. **Command Palette Method:**
    - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
    - Type **"Smart Context: Copy Folder Contents to Clipboard"**.
    - Select the folder and your contents are instantly copied.

The extension scans the folder for relevant text files (based on a wide range of file extensions), excludes files listed in `.gitignore`, and organizes the content for easy pasting.

### Why Choose Smart Context?

There are many tools out there for sharing code snippets, but **Smart Context** stands out because it offers something critical that many alternatives donâ€™t: **complete privacy**. Unlike cloud-based services that upload your code to external servers, Smart Context ensures your code never leaves your machine.

Hereâ€™s why Smart Context is the best choice:
